# GSheet Auto - Article Processor and Organizer.

A web application that processes news articles, checks their relevance based on category tags, and organizes them into Google Sheets. The system includes a crawler for finding relevant articles and a sophisticated article processor for extracting and summarizing content.

## Features

- **Article Processing**: Extract and summarize content from news articles using TextRank algorithm
- **Content Relevance Checking**: Verify if articles contain keywords relevant to specific categories
- **Google Sheets Integration**: Store relevant articles in categorized sheets
- **Web Crawler**: Find articles from defined publishers related to specific topics
- **Unused Article Management**: Track and manage articles that don't match relevance criteria

## Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Place your Google Sheets API credentials in a file named `credentials.json`
4. Run the application:
   ```
   python app.py
   ```

## API Endpoints

### Article Processing

- `POST /scrape-article` - Extract and process a single article
  ```json
  {
    "url": "https://example.com/article",
    "category": "AI Policy",
    "publisher": "Example Publisher"
  }
  ```

- `POST /scrape-articles-batch` - Process multiple articles at once
  ```json
  {
    "articles": [
      {
        "url": "https://example.com/article1",
        "category": "AI Policy",
        "publisher": "Example Publisher"
      },
      {
        "url": "https://example.com/article2",
        "category": "AI Governance",
        "publisher": "Another Publisher"
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

### Unused Links Management

- `GET /unused-links` - Get all links that didn't match category tags
- `DELETE /unused-links` - Delete unused links based on filters
  ```json
  {
    "category": "AI Policy",
    "publisher": "Example Publisher",
    "before_date": "2023-01-01T00:00:00",
    "all": false
  }
  ```
- `POST /unused-links/recover` - Recover an unused link and add it to Google Sheets
  ```json
  {
    "url": "https://example.com/article",
    "category": "AI Policy",
    "summary": "Optional custom summary",
    "title": "Optional custom title"
  }
  ```

### Google Sheets Management

- `GET /worksheets` - List all worksheets
- `POST /create-worksheet` - Create a new worksheet
- `POST /delete-worksheet` - Delete a worksheet
- `POST /add-link` - Add a link to a worksheet
- `GET /worksheet-data?name=SheetName` - Get data from a specific worksheet

### Crawler Settings

- `GET /crawler-settings` - Get crawler settings
- `POST /crawler-settings` - Add or update a publisher
- `DELETE /crawler-settings/{category}/{publisher}` - Remove a publisher
- `GET /crawler-settings/tags/{category}` - Get tags for a category
- `PUT /crawler-settings/tags/{category}` - Update tags for a category

## How It Works

### Article Processing

The system extracts content from articles using two methods:
1. **Primary method**: Uses newspaper3k to parse article content
2. **Fallback method**: Uses BeautifulSoup with randomized user agents

After extraction, the article is summarized using the TextRank algorithm, which:
1. Breaks text into sentences
2. Creates a similarity matrix between sentences
3. Uses PageRank to identify the most important sentences
4. Assembles top sentences into a coherent summary

### Relevance Checking

For each article:
1. The system loads tags associated with the article's category
2. Checks if any tags are present in the article text
3. If matching tags are found, the article is considered relevant
4. Relevant articles are added to Google Sheets, while irrelevant ones are saved to `unused_links.json`

## Configuration

- `crawler_settings.json`: Contains publisher information and category tags
- `config.json`: Contains the Google Sheet ID
- `crawled_links.json`: Stores links found by the crawler
- `unused_links.json`: Stores links that didn't match relevance criteria
